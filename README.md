# UP-Finder
A genome-scale modeling tool to identify gene overexpression strategies.


To initiate the UP Finder (GUI), try the following steps that may help to solve the potential errors:
[1] Check if the COBRA toolbox runs well for reading SBML model and also check if LP solver runs well;
[2] To initiate GUI, right click "software_gui.m" and click "Run" to open the interface, then it would be fine to load an organism model.
